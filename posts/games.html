    <h1>Games</h1>

    <p>
      I started college as a combined major in Computer Science and Game
      Design, and have an interest in making videogames. That hasn't entirely
      gone away, and I still poke away at a couple projects when I can. These
      are approximately newest-to-oldest.
    </p>

    <a href="https://github.com/ThoseGrapefruits/pong-racket">
      <h2>Pong Racket</h2>
    </a>
    <p>
      This is a 3D (rendering, not movement) Pong clone using the
      <code>pict3d</code> rendering library. It's been fun to get back into the
      wonderful world of Racket.
    </p>

    <a href="https://github.com/ThoseJackfruits/Bobbin">
      <h2>Bobbin</h2>
    </a>
    <p>
      Bobbin was an attempt at making a text-based game engine for creating
      console adventure games. It features a room system, inventory
      management, and an unnecessarily complex history system that uses
      exceptions and the callstack. I love it with all my heart.
    </p>

    <a href="http://www.flowlab.io/game/play/103175">
      <h2>Tumbleweed Tango</h2>
    </a>
    <p>
      Unfortunately, most of this game is very broken now, probably a result
      of both Flash and Flowlab changing significantly in the years since I
      made it. As of writing, none of the sound works and there are a few
      graphical and gameplay issues, not to mention that it takes quite a
      while to load. It was fun to work on, though. Especially designing the
      sprites.
    </p>

    <a href="https://github.com/ThoseGrapefruits/Office-Rumpus">
      <h2>Office Rumpus</h2>
    </a>
    <p>
      This was my first major programming project, back in high school. It was
      more of a 2D interactive environment than a game, but I was proud of it
      anyways.
