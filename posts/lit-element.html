    <h1><code>lit</code></h1>
    <p>
      For a while, I've been looking for a decent way to build a very simple
      website that could host both blog post like things and fuller pages. I
      wanted something that didn't require a build step (like every single
      static-site-from-markdown generator. The main things I wanted were:
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>No build step</li>
      <li>Easy to edit</li>
      <li>Very customisable, especially styling. Ideally, no built-in
        styling</li>
      <li>Didn't require a ton of code to get something basic working</li>
    </ol>

    <p>
      I've been using <a href="https://lit.dev"><code>lit</code></a>
      on Knudge for a while now, which has been very rewarding. It's great to
      work with, and it lets you use a ton of stuff that is (thank goodness)
      built into modern browsers. So, I gave it a shot.
    </p>

      It's been nice so far. There are downsides, like having to write posts
      in plain HTML as opposed to Markdown. I also still need to figure out
      a nicer way to import <code>lit</code> without using unpkg, since the long
      tail of that can be very slow. There's also a fair amount of CSS
      duplication, as the same stuff that has to be top-level also has to be
      included in most of the custom elements' stylesheets.  All that being
      said, though, I think I'll stick with this for now. It certainly gives me
      the flexibility I've been looking for.
