    <h1>Joysticks</h1>
    <p>
      A while back, I wrote an
      <a href="http://answers.unity.com/answers/1783398/view.html">
        answer to a forum question on how to calculate the overall intensity
        (magnitude) of a joystick axis</a>...
      6 years after the question was asked. Yeah, I'm one of those, sorry.
      This is a copy of that post for my own records, in case that answer
      ever goes away. Hopefully it's helpful to you as well!

    <p>
      I decided to answer this question because I was looking for the answer
      myself, not for a Unity project but for a project in JS. I figured the
      Unity forums would be a pretty good knowledge source for
      joystick-related issues, so I happily clicked that search result.
      Unfortunately, the two existing answers (including the accepted one)
      were wrong. Worse still, when I read them, I knew <em>exactly</em> what
      those felt like in videogames (games where your fastest movement speed
      is when you are moving at a 45° angle). Anyways, here's my answer:

    <h1>My answer</h1>

    <p>
      In order to do this right, you have to normalise against the maximum
      possible magnitude for that angle. If you just clamp the magnitude of
      the vector to <code>[0, 1]</code>, then you only have to move
      <code>Mathf.Sqrt(magnitude)</code> in any diagonal direction to get the
      same normalised magnitude as moving <code>magnitude</code> in a
      horizontal or vertical direction. You run into the opposite problem if
      you just take the max of the 2 magnitudes, where diagonals are
      underrepresented instead of overrepresented.

    <h2>
      The code (C#, using Unity's <code>Vector2</code> and <code>Mathf</code>)
    </h2>
    <pre aria-describedby="c-sharp-cod-description">
    Vector2 vector = new Vector2(
      Input.GetAxis("Horizontal"),
      Input.GetAxis("Vertical")
    );

    float angle = Mathf.Atan2(vector.x, vector.y);
    float maxMagnitude = Mathf.Abs(vector.x) > Mathf.Abs(vector.y)
      ? 1 / Mathf.Sin(angle)
      : 1 / Mathf.Cos(angle);
    float magnitude = abs(vector.magnitude / maxMagnitude);
    </pre>

    <p id="c-sharp-cod-description">
      The code above is C# and Unity specific, but it's pretty easy to adapt
      for any environment/language that has basic floating-point or decimal
      math functions and where the joystick input is 2 separate axes, each in
      the range of <code>[-1, 1]</code>. Since I was looking for a JS answer,
      it would be rude of me not to include my JS solution:
    
    <pre>
    function vectorFromJoystick({ x, y }) {
      const direction = Math.atan2(y, x);
      const directionAbsolute = direction < 0
        ? TAU + direction
        : direction;

      const rawMagnitude = Math.sqrt(x ** 2 + y ** 2);
      const maxMagnitude = Math.abs(x) > Math.abs(y)
        ? 1 / Math.sin(direction)
        : 1 / Math.cos(direction);
      const magnitude = rawMagnitude / Math.abs(maxMagnitude);

      return { direction, directionAbsolute, magnitude };
    }
    </pre>

    <p id="js-cod-description">
      I had some additional requirements/concerns with this that came out of how
      JS's built-in <code>Math</code> functions work. <code>Math.atan2</code>
      returns a number in the range <code>[-π, π]</code>. I added
      <code>directionAbsolute</code> which converts that to its
      <code>[0, 2π]</code> unit circle equivalent. That might be an issue with
      the C# code as well, as I did not test that as heavily as the JS one.

    <h2>The explanation</h2>
    <img
      alt="unit circle with enclosing rectangle and 2 sample points"
      aria-describedby="image-info"

    />

    <p id="image-info">
      The circle here is the unit circle, and the enclosing square encloses
      all possible {x,y} values that can be given back by a joystick. The
      orange and pink dots are 2 example positions of the joystick, which
      fall into the 2 separate pink and orange tinted parts of the graph
      respectively. These tinted areas represent the 2 different cases that
      are handled by the ternary in the code above — more on that later.

    <p>
      The fundamental problem is that the magnitude coming out of the vector
      is relative to that outer square, but you want the magnitude relative
      to the unit circle, so that it is always in the range [0, 1]. You also
      want it to stay proportional no matter where the joystick is, so if the
      joystick's current values fall outside of the unit circle (e.g.
      <code>{ x: 0.9, y: 0.9 }</code>) the output magnitude should be almost
      but not quite 100%, because the user isn't actually pushing the
      joystick full-speed-ahead in that direction.

    <p>
      The solution is pretty straightforward: we take the vector's value and
      divide it by the maximum possible magnitude at that angle. In the
      diagram, the vector's value is the solid coloured line, and the maximum
      possible magnitude is that plus the dotted line extending all the way
      to the edge of the square.
    
    <p>
      Like I said before, there are 2 cases. Both are gonna use some trig to
      calculate the maximum possible lengths, taking advantage of the fact
      that we're working with right triangles.

    <h3 style="color: magenta">The pink case</h3>
    <p>
      Looking at the diagram, we know θ<sub>1</sub> (the <code>angle</code>)
      and the length of the adjacent side from that corner (that pink
      <b>1</b>). We want to find h<sub>1</sub>, which is the maximum possible
      magnitude at that angle. Referring to your trigonometric ratios (or
      wikipedia if you're like me and forgot them all) you'll see that the
      cosine of an angle θ is the ratio between the adjacent side and the
      hypotenuse, so we can use that to calculate the length of the
      hypotenuse. The formula is:
    <pre>
    cos(θ1) = adjacent / hypotenuse = 1 / h1
    </pre>
    Solving for h1, we get:
    <pre>
    h1 = 1 / cos(θ1)
    </pre>

    <h3 style="color: orange">The orange case</h3>
    <p>
      The problem we're solving is exactly the same here: how long is the
      hypotenuse (`h<sub>2</sub>` in this case). However, the 1-length side is now
      opposite θ<sub>2</sub> instead of adjacent to it (you can see this side
      in faint dotted orange). No problem, as sine is the ratio between the
      opposite and hypotenuse.
    
    <pre>
    sin(θ2) = opposite / hypotenuse = 1 / h2
    </pre>

    again, solving for h2 this time:

    <pre>
    h2 = 1 / sin(θ2)
    </pre>
